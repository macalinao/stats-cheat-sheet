# Chapter 7 -- Queuing Systems

## Arrival

A counting process $A(t)$ tells the number of arrivals that occurred by the time $t$.

### Arrival rate

$$
\lambda_A = \frac{EA(t)}{t}
$$

For any $t > 0$, which is the expected arrivals per 1 unit of time.

### Expected time between arrivals

$$
\mu_A = \frac{1}{\lambda_A}
$$

## Service

### Service rate

$$
\lambda_S = \frac{1}{\mu_S}
$$
